### Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

 * Ant Design
 * React.Js
 * Redux toolkit
 * Css3
 * Flex-box
